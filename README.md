# rcast
A lightweight DLNA/UPnP MediaRenderer (DMR) for macOS written in Go. It discovers as a DLNA renderer on your LAN, accepts Play/Pause/Stop and volume controls from controllers (mobile apps, Windows “Play To”, etc.), and plays media via IINA. Includes session ownership to prevent conflicting casts and optional linkage to macOS system volume.
